## Planned

- NEI support built in
- Oops all taint world type
- Essentia Phial to become Essentia Bottle
    - Reasons why:
        - It is more consistent with the rest of the game
    - Additional part for this change:
        - Make it so NEI nests them like vanilla potions.

## Denied ideas

- Anything Terraria copy-cat
- Anything TC7 copy-cat (Before it's been out for a month)
