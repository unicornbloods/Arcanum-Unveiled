# Compatibility

## Compatible

- Any addon that uses the Thaumcraft API should work as an end goal. As detailed in
  the [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTION-GUIDELINES.md).

## Incompatible

- TBD

## Incompatible Won't Fix

- Anything that uses mixins on Thaumcraft4
    - [Salis Arcana](https://github.com/rndmorris/Salis-Arcana)
    - [TC4 Tweask](https://github.com/Glease/TC4Tweaks)
    - [Thaumic Mixins](https://github.com/unicornbloods/Thaumic-Mixins)
- CraftTweaker / ModTweaker (Uses a lot of the API so idk)
    - Plan to integrate its functionality into Arcanum Unveiled configs.

## Dependencies

- Thaumcraft
    - Obvious reason
- Baubles Expanded
    - Baubles support
- EFR (Or future banner stand-alone mod)
    - Vanilla styled banners that don't reinvent the wheel, and don't look out of place. Will add the Thaumcraft banner
      patterns.
- NBTStructureLib
    - Makes it super easy to add new structures or for the user / other mods to add to structure pools like the rooms
      for the Labyrinth.
